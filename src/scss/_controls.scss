$sidebarText: "Dwight Clark, has died at 61 after a battle with ALS. The former High School quaterback, and college strong safety, was drafted in the 10th round by the 49ers. He became a crucial part of 2 Super Bowl winning teams and made one of the most memorable catches of all time in the 1981 NFC Championship Game. 'The Catch', the result of a broken play and great chemistry between QB and WR, gave the 49ers a 28-27 win over Cowboys and brought them to their first ever Super Bowl appearance. He was larger than life, handsome, charismatic and the only one who could pull off wearing a fur coat at a Super Bowl parade. He will be missed.";
