$sidebarText: "Former Baltimore Colts linebacker Mike Curtis has passed away. The 14 year NFL vet was drafted by the Colts in the 1st round of the 1965 NFL Draft and was originally drafted as a fullback. Curtis switched sides to linebacker and became a mainstay of that era. Curtis was a 4x Pro Bowler, 2x First-Team All-Pro and was the 1970 AFC Defensive Player of the Year. Curtis played an integral part in Baltimore's victory over Dallas in Super Bowl V, when he made a critical interception in the final minutes that set up the game-winning field goal. Curtis later became a member of the inaugural 1976 Seahawks squad and finished his career in Washington. Curtis was 77 years old. Rest in peace.";
