$sidebarText: "The Seahawks rewrote the book on how they win games against the Steelers on Sunday. The Seahawks used a high flying offense to keep them in the game despite their defense having trouble holding Pittsburgh's high-powered offense at bay.  Russell Wilson connected with receiver Doug Baldwin six times for 145 yards and 3 touchdowns en route to the first 39-30 victory in NFL history.";
