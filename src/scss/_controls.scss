$sidebarText: "In an otherwise hapless season, the Houston Texans notched a season-defining 27-20 victory over the New England Patriots on Sunday afternoon. Deshaun Watson's heroics (both through the air and on the ground) helped carry the Texans to a victory, while Houston's normally-poor rush defense showed out against the likes of Cam Newton and Damien Harris. The oft-injured Will Fuller continued to shine, setting a new career high for receiving yards in just Week 11. This loss moves New England to an unfamiliar 4-6 and in great danger of missing the playoffs, a position which they have not finished in since 2008.";
