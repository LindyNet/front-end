$sidebarText: "The Philadelphia Eagles pulled off a thrilling win against the rival New York Giants this past Sunday. After holding a 14-0 lead for most of the game, the Giants came roaring back behind three 4th-quarter Eli Manning TD passes. Eagles rookie RB Corey Clement scored on a 15-yard TD scamper, knotting the game at 21. With only 0:51 remaining, Eagles K Jake Elliott hit a 46-yard FG, once again tying the score at 24. Following a big completion to WR Alshon Jeffrey, the Eagles set up Elliott for a 61-yard try on the final play. His kick was true (sneaking inside the right upright), and Elliott became an instant hero in Philadelphia, as they knocked off the Giants, 27-24.";
