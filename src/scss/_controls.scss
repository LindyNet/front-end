$sidebarText: "Everyone counted the 0-5 Giants out after OBJ's injury--exactly what Eli Manning and company wanted. On Sunday night, the team rebounded with a convincing win in all phases. Its much-maligned offensive line opened holes for RB Orleans Darkwa, who racked up 117 yards on the ground--more than Ezekiel Elliott, LeSean McCoy, Melvin Gordon, and Marshawn Lynch *combined* when they played Denver. The defense contained the Broncos and forced turnovers, including a defensive score. And who needs WRs when Evan Engram can catch 5 passes for 82 yards and the team's sole offensive TD?";
