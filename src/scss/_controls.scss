$sidebarText: "The Cleveland Browns notched their biggest win in recent memory on Sunday, defeating the Tennessee Titans 41-35. Despite an off week from Cleveland's normally-unstoppable backfield, Baker Mayfield's four first-half touchdown passes propelled the squad to a 38-7 halftime lead. Meanwhile, the defense held Derrick Henry to a paltry 60 rushing yards. This victory secures the Browns' first winning season since 2007 and moves them closer to ending their 18-year playoff drought.";
