$sidebarText: "The Carolina Panthers have been hot all year, but they might have reached Super Nova with their 49-15 win over the Arizona Cardinals in the NFC Championship game. They dominated in all phases of the game, forcing 7 turnovers on defense and scoring with explosive plays on offense. Their victory brings them to 17-1 on the season, and they'll face the Broncos in Santa Clara in Super Bowl 50.";
