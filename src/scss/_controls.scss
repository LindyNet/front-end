$sidebarText: "The Cleveland Browns hired former Kansas City GM John Dorsey on Thursday. Many NFL media figures praised the move, focusing on Dorsey's record as a talent evaluator and the Chiefs' 43-21 record during his time with the organization. The Browns have over $100 million in cap space and 6 picks in the first 3 rounds of the 2018 NFL draft, giving Dorsey a strong base to continue Cleveland's rebuild.";
