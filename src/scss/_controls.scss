$sidebarText: "Atlanta Falcons DE Adrian Clayborn was a one-man army against the Dallas Cowboys in a 27-7 win. With Tyron Smith not playing, Clayborn racked up 6 sacks, a team all-time record and tied for the second-most for a single player in NFL history. Only Hall of Famer Derrick Thomas has more sacks in a single game (7). The Falcons are still in the middle of the NFC playoff race and will face the Seattle Seahawks on Monday Night Football this week.";
