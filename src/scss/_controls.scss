$sidebarText: "Derrick Henry rushed for an astounding 238 yards and four touchdowns on just 17 carries. His 99-yard touchdown run tied Tony Dorsett for the longest rush in NFL history, and was the high point of a night to remember for Henry. This game vaulted him up the season rushing leaderboard, and Henry will look to continue this success as the Titans make a final push for the playoffs.";
