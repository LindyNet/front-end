The "Kansas Comet" was known for his electrifying style of play, receiving five straight first-team all-pro honors from 1965 to 1969. Sayers is a member of the NFL 100th Anniversary Team and is considered one of the greatest kick returners of all time. Despite a relatively short seven-year career due to injuries, Sayers was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1977.";
