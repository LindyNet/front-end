A team that analysts and experts were certain would be in contention for the first overall draft pick has just capped off a 3-game win streak. The defense, lead by a pair of impressive rookie safeties in Jamal Adams and Marcus Maye, forced 3 turnovers in that game and has shown up big in the team's wins.";
