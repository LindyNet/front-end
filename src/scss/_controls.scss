RB Leonard Fournette scored 3 touchdowns, while the defense returned both an interception and a fumble for two additional scores in the 42-35 win. The Jags' running game and defense, both arguably #1 in the league, will need to be at the top of their game if the team hopes for an upset win this Sunday.";
