$sidebarText: "Josh Allen posted a nearly flawless performance on Sunday as the Buffalo Bills beat the Seattle Seahawks. Taking advantage of Seattle's 32nd-ranked pass defense, the Bills jumped out to 17-0 lead and never looked back, scoring on four of their five first-half drives. A third-quarter scoring outburst by the Seahawks made things interesting, but four turnovers hindered any Seattle momentum. The Bills are now 7-2 and lead the AFC East, a position they have not finished in since 1994.";
