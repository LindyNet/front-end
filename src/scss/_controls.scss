$sidebarText: "The New Orleans Saints have won three games in a row--and they haven't done it how you'd expect. Drew Brees and the offense are playing well, but their historically problematic defense has stepped up under second-year DC Dennis Allen. In the last 3 weeks, the D held the Panthers to 13, shut out the Dolphins, and directly scored 21 points on the Lions. And this week, Cameron Jordan won the NFC Defensive Player of the Week for his 2 sack, 1 interception day; it's the first time a Saint has done so since 2014.";
