$sidebarText: " Longtime NFL head coach and Hall of Famer Don Shula has passed away at the age of 90. Shula spent seven seasons in the NFL as a defensive back for Cleveland, Baltimore and Washington and would become the Colts head coach soon after. Shula's Colts teams were extremely successful but his loss in Super Bowl III precipitated his exit. Miami clearly benefited from this as Shula would spend 26 seasons making the Dolphins one of the most dominant teams in the league. Shula won 5 AFC titles and 2 Super Bowls in his Miami tenure and had only 2 losing seasons in his 33 as a head coach. Shula won 328 regular season games and 347 career games, both of which are league records. Shula was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1997. Rest in peace.";
