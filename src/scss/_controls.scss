Seattle and Atlanta are vying for the final invitation to the NFC dance. Atlanta can win and waltz in, but a Seattle victory and a Falcons loss would have the Seahawks cut in. The AFC has a four team scramble for the two wild-card berths between the Bills, Titans, Chargers, and Ravens. Baltimore and Tennessee have the inside track, but Los Angeles and Buffalo look to spoil the playoff party.";
