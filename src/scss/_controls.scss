After shutting out the Bengals 20-0 in their opening day matchup, they continued their destructive ways against the Cleveland Browns in Week Two. As a whole, the unit tallied 2 sacks, 3 TFLs, 4 interceptions, and 4 QB hits. This ferocious defense will look to continue imposing their will against the Jacksonville Jaguars this Sunday.";
