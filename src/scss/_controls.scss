$sidebarText: "Former Green Bay Packers defensive end and Hall of Famer Willie Davis has passed away at the age of 85. Drafted by the Browns out of Grambling State in the 15th round in 1958, Davis was traded to Green Bay in 1960 and would spend the next 10 seasons becoming a Packers legend. Among his achievements are 5 first-team All Pro selections, member of the NFL 1960s All-Decade team and 21 recovered fumbles with the Packers, which remains a team record. Davis was a captain, mentor, leader and an integral part of the Lombardi-era Packers teams that won 5 NFL titles and the first 2 Super Bowls. Davis was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1981. Rest in peace.";
