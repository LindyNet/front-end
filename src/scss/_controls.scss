$sidebarText: "The Chiefs offense was at full throttle against the Steelers, as second-year QB Patrick Mahomes threw more TDs (6) than incompletions (5). With 326 yards passing in a 42-37 win over Pittsburgh, the Chiefs offensive fireworks have just begun. Headlined by names such as Tyreek Hill, Travis Kelce, and Sammy Watkins, Mahomes has all the weapons in the world to work with. With a date against the 49ers coming up this Sunday, the Chiefs are hoping their explosive offense can come to play once again.";
