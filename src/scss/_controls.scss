$sidebarText: "The Washington Redskins defeated the Seattle Seahawks in exciting fashion on Sunday, as RB Rob Kelley's one-yard plunge with 0:59 remaining gave the visitors a 17-14 lead which they would not relinquish. The game-winning score was set up thanks to a 38-yard catch by a diving Josh Doctson. Despite being a low-scoring affair throughout most of the contest, Russell Wilson engineered what appeared to be a game-winning TD drive, before Kirk Cousins created some magic of his own to lead the Redskins to an improbable win in the Pacific Northwest.";
