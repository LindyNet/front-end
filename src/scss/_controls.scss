$sidebarText: "The leader of Miami's 'No Name Defense', linebacker Nick Buoniconti, has died at age 78. He was an integral part of leading the Dolphins to 3 consecutive Super Bowls, winning 2, including the only undefeated season in NFL history in 1972. Buoniconti made a tremendous impact off the field as well. He also was an attorney, sports agent, president of US Tobacco and a co-host of HBO's 'Inside the NFL.' The Miami Project to Cure Paralysis was founded in 1985 after Nick's son Marc Buoniconti was paralyzed from the shoulders down after sustaining a hit during a college football game.";
