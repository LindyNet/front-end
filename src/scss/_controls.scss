$sidebarText: "The Detroit Lions defeated the Washington Football Team 30-27 in a thrilling Sunday affair. Alex Smith had the best game of his NFL comeback, throwing for 380 yards. However, he was outdueled by Matthew Stafford, whose three passing touchdowns marked another stellar performance for the longtime stud. A Matt Prater 59-yard field goal on the final play gave Detroit a nail-biting win after they blew a 24-3 third-quarter lead. A win next week against the Panthers could move the Lions to .500 on the season.";
