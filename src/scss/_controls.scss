$sidebarText: "Denver Broncos owner Pat Bowlen passed away on June 13th after a lengthy battle with Alzheimer's Disease. The Hall Fame inductee oversaw one of the most successful runs in the NFL during his tenure, with the Broncos accumulating more Super Bowl appearances (8) than losing seasons (7) since he purchased the team in 1983. In Denver he will be most remembered for his charitable works with the Denver Boys &  Girls Club and his demands that his players won not only on the field, but in their communities as well.";
