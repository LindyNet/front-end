$sidebarText: "The Philadelphia Eagles recently gave a 4 year, $128M extension to QB Carson Wentz, locking him up through the 2024 season. The former 2nd overall pick has shown impressive talent in his time as Eagles QB but also has a significant injury history in his 3 years as a pro. Wentz's new deal not only puts pressure on Wentz to succeed in the coming years, it will also likely become a benchmark for the recent wave of QBs and the extensions they may seek in the coming years.";
