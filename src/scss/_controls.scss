$sidebarText: "The Arizona Cardinals beat the Jacksonville Jaguars in a 27-24 thriller last Sunday. Former Jaguars QB Blaine Gabbert led the Cardinals to a victory, as his two big completions moved the ball 22 yards to set up a game-winning field goal attempt. From there, the 42-year old veteran Phil Dawson took over, drilling the 57-yard kick, and giving the Cardinals the lead with 0:01 left. The win is the biggest one of their season, against a team that appears to be playoff-bound.";
