$sidebarText: "Down 21-3 in Arrowhead late in the 3rd quarter, the Tennessee Titans needed a small miracle to mount a comeback. QB Marcus Mariota's deflected pass bouncing back into his hands for a TD provided that spark. The 19-point rally wasn't all Mariota, as RB Derrick Henry set a franchise record with 191 scrimmage yards and a TD. The Titans travel to New England, where the defending Super Bowl champions are heavy favorites; both players will need repeat performances if they hope for another upset win.";
