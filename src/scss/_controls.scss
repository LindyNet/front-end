$sidebarText: "The Pittsburgh Steelers moved to 7-0 with a victory over the Baltimore Ravens on Saturday. A historical rivalry matchup once again came down to the final seconds, as Lamar Jackson's pass to the endzone fell incomplete on the final play of the game. Jackson's four turnovers badly hurt a Ravens offense already facing a dominant Pittsburgh defense. The Steelers are the 38th team since the 1970 NFL merger to be 7-0, and every one of these teams went on to make the playoffs.";
