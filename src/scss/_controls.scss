$sidebarText: "WJIII gained a lot of hype from his blazing Combine 40, but CFB fans and scouts had their eyes on him long before then. He has the size, speed, and aggressive press techniques to thrive as a prototypical corner in the NFL, and his tracking skills to defend passes are phenomenal. He's a bit overly physical at times, but teams will take that for the shutdown coverage he can provide.";
