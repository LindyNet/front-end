$sidebarText: "The New York Jets did the unthinkable on Sunday, defeating the Los Angeles Rams 23-20. Despite being the first win of an otherwise hapless season, this victory drops the Jets out of the #1 spot in the 2021 NFL Draft - potentially costing the franchise superstar QB Trevor Lawrence. An abnormally poor outing from the Rams' offense allowed the Jets to build a 13-3 halftime lead which survived a 10-point fourth-quarter scoring outburst from Los Angeles. This victory moves the Jacksonville Jaguars into the top draft spot and forces Gang Green to potentially reconsider their offseason strategy.";
