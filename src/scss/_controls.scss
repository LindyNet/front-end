All the red hot New Orleans Saints needed to do to lock up #3 seed was win against the 4th-place Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Bucs, already eliminated from the playoffs, didn't roll over. Down 24-20 with 7 minutes left in the 4th quarter, Tampa Bay rattled off 11 unanswered points to win 31-24 and knock their divisional rival down to the #4 seed.";
