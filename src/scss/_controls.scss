Drafted by New England in the 6th round in 2000, Brady became arguably the most successful QB in NFL history, becoming the centerpiece of a two-decade long dynasty where the Patriots appeared in nine Super Bowls and won six. Brady also compiled a 219-64 (0.774) career record in the regular season and currently has the 2nd most career passing yards in NFL history.";
