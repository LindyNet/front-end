$sidebarText: "The Philadelphia Eagles pulled off a monster upset Sunday afternoon, downing the #1 seed New Orleans Saints 24-21. Rookie QB Jalen Hurts became just the second player this season to cross the rushing century mark against the normally-stout Saints defense. Hurts was assisted by a big day from Miles Sanders, whose 82-yard rushing touchdown gave Philadelphia a 17-0 halftime lead. Despite a second-half New Orleans rally, the Eagles hung on to snap the Saints' 10-game winning streak.";
