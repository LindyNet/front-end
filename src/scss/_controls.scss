$sidebarText: "Legendary defensive end Fred Dean passed away today at the age of 68 due to COVID-19 complications. Drafted by the San Diego Chargers in 1975, Dean would go on to win two Super Bowls with the San Francisco 49ers while leading a talented defensive unit that complemented its offense perfectly. The 2x First-Team All-Pro totaled six sacks in his first game as a 49er and was named Defensive Player of the Year in his first year with the team. Not to be outdone, his 1983 campaign featured a whopping 17 sacks and his last of four Pro Bowl nods. Dean was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2008 and is also a member of the College Football Hall of Fame.";
