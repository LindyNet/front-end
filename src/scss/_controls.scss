$sidebarText: "A year ago today, one of the most beloved players in Raiders history died and we failed to recognize him. Old Man Willie Brown, the inventor of bump-and-run coverage, was acquired from the Broncos in 1967 and lifted the Raiders to a Super Bowl XI victory with a 75-yard pick six. He added two more titles in Super Bowls XV and XVIII. Brown retired as a five-time AFL All-Star, four-time NFL Pro Bowler, two-time All-Pro, and 1970s NFL All-Decade Team selection. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1984 and is a member of the NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team.";
