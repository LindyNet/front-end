They are flying away to a 3-1 record and the AFC East division lead, and in those wins they weren't just flying away on a wing and a prayer, they looked legit. With a defense allowing just 13.5 points per game and an offense predicated on grinding opponents down, people around the league are no longer asking, who could they be? Believe it or not, it's just Shady.";
