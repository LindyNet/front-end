$sidebarText: "One of the bigger names in free agency made a move as TE Jared Cook signed a 2 year contract with the Saints worth $15.5M. Cook had a very strong 2018 season in Oakland, amassing career highs in receptions, receiving yards and touchdowns. It's said that the Patriots made a strong run at Cook due to a recent need at the position, but Cook chose to pair up with Drew Brees in the Big Easy.";
