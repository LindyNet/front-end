$sidebarText: "The Texans had a record-setting Sunday, scoring a franchise-high 57 points against the overwhelmed Tennessee Titans this past Sunday. They smashed the previous franchise record (45) by 12 points, giving their division rivals a beating they won't soon forget. Rookie sensation DeShaun Watson threw for 283 yards and 4 TDs, while also rushing for one more. The defense totaled 4 INTs, as Titans starting QB Marcus Mariota injured his hamstring during the affair. The Texans will look to build off this big win as they prepare to face the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 5.";
