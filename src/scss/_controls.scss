$sidebarText: "Thursday Night Football returned with action from the Steelers and Patriots. Although, mared in controversy and fallout from legal procedings, America was happy for the regular season to begin. The game featured various players, but none came more of a surprise than Dion Lewis. Lewis bounced from team to team until finally arriving in New England in December of last year. Thursday marked his first game action since 2012. Rushing for 69 yards on 15 attempts and catching 4 passes for 51 yards, Lewis was a pivotal player in the Patriots 28-21 routing of Pittsburgh.";
