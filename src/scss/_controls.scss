$sidebarText: "It was another typical Seahawks-Rams game on Sunday, as both squads combined to turn the ball over 7 times in a low-scoring affair. Earl Thomas' superhuman goal line effort likely saved the game for Seattle, erasing 7 points in a 16-10 game. It's the Seahawks' first win in the Rams' stadium since 2013. Both teams sit at a 3-2, and their rematch later in the season will likely determine the NFC West champion.";
