$sidebarText: "Former Green Bay Packers QB, head coach and Hall of Famer Bart Starr has passed away at the age of 85. Starr, best known for his game-winning QB sneak in the final moments of the Ice Bowl, was also heralded as an exemplary role model and a consummate professional. As a player, Starr spent his long career defying the odds and making plays when it mattered most. In addition to being the MVP of both Super Bowls I and II, Starr was the first QB to win five NFL titles and the only QB to do so within a decade. A career-long Packer, Starr played for Green Bay from 1956-71 and served as Packers head coach from 1975-83. Bart Starr left an indelible mark on the game of pro football and he will be sorely missed.";
