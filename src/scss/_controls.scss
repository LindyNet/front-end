$sidebarText: "The Minnesota Vikings won decisively over the Washington Redskins 38-30 this weekend, as QB Case Keenum tossed 4 TDs in a winning effort. Standout Vikings WR Adam Thielen was a big contributor as well, hauling in eight receptions for 166 yards and a score. With the team firmly in the playoff picture, Vikings fans hope that whoever becomes the long-term starter at QB can continue to feed Thielen the ball, as he has been on a tear for the past several games.";
