Among them are the addition of an eighth game official called the sky judge and a senior tech advisor to assist the officiating crew, disallowing repeated dead-ball fouls when the clock is running, and a major alternative to the onside kick. This alternative would allow teams that trail in games to keep the ball after scoring by attempting a 4th-and-15 play from their own 25. The team on offense would keep the ball if they convert and it can only be done twice.";
