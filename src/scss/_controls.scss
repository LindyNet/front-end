$sidebarText: "Green Bay Packer legend Paul Hornung passed away at the age of 84 today following a lengthy battle with dementia. The first overall pick in 1957, Hornung was nominated to his first Pro Bowl in 1959 and won his first NFL championship in 1961 (as well as league MVP), beginning a dynasty that produced four championships by the end of the decade. Packers head coach Coach Vince Lombardi referred to Hornung as "the greatest player I ever coached," a tremendous endorsement. Hornung retired in 1967 following a neck injury and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1986.";
